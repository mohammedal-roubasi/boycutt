# Image-recognition-with-ai
This project and its simple interfaces work on recognizing images based on the model that the trainer gives Using Yolo algorithm version 8 

## introduction

The model was trained to recognize the boycotted goods, and I trained it on the producers of Pepsi and Coca-Cola. It can recognize pictures, videos, or webcams that contain these products. The project has simple interfaces in which the results are displayed. You can train your own model and link it together with the interfaces and use it. Enter the UI file and modify ```"model_name = 'best.pt'" ``` to ```"model_name = 'YOUR_MODLE.pt'"```
